# ðŸ›¬ Planes
Implemented a game similar to Battleship (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)), using object-oriented programming, layered architecture, and graphical user interface, together with some basic computer AI the user can play against. The game is described [here](https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avioane_(joc)) - it's a similar game with Battleship, but instead of ships, there are used planes.
